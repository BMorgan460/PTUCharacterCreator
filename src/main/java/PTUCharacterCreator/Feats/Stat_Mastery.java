Defense Effect: Whenever your Pokemon do not spend their Shift Action to Shift during a turn, they gain +5 Damage Reduction for one full round. Special Attack Effect: The Range of your Pokemons Special Non-Melee Moves is increased by +2. This does not affect the size of Area-Of-Effect moves (But does affect the range at which you can place Ranged Blasts). Special Defense Effect: Whenever your Pokemon would lose a Tick of Hit Points from Status Afflictions, Weather, or other effects, they lose 5 fewer Hit Points, to a minimum of 1. Speed Effect: Your Pokemon may take Disengage Maneuvers as Swift Actions.";
