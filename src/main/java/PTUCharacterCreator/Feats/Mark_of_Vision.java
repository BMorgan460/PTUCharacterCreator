You may Bind this Ability multiple times, each time on a different target, but you may only concentrate on one Mark of Vision at a time, and you may only have a number of Marks at one time equal to half your Perception Rank. A target may choose to end this effect at any time, or to deny you access to their senses temporarily without ending the effect entirely. You have a rough sense of how far away and in what direction marked targets are.";
