Whenever the target is attacked by a foe within 6 meters, they may expend a Fairy Light to either immediately gain a Tick of Temporary Hit Points, or to use the Move Fairy Wind as a Free Action.  Special: Fairy Lights also provide mild lighting, comparable to a candle. As an extended action your Pokemon can control the lights individually, but they must stay within 6 meters of the Pokemon that created them.";
